Respected Sir,

This is a basic E-Commerce POC that makes use of Handlebars as a templating tool and Gulp.

Clone the Repo.

1. Run : npm start
2. Install the local-web-server module globally : npm i local-web-server -g
3. Switch to the dist/ folder : cd dist
4. Hit "ws" on command prompt.

There is an added support of i18n (please explore).
